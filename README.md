Filter Project JS

So, after getting rejecting for another job and after moping around because of it, I decided to stop wasting
my time and focus on projects. At this moment, I am more of the opinion that if 30+ projects are not enough, then 200 will be :D

Anyway, I did reuse little bit of code from project I did for Inchoo but with little twist. Biggest problem
in this project was that input, and how to make it take each letter and make it more responsive on each letter that is inputted.
After trying out regex which I probably did not implement properly or something else was messing with the code, I did revert to
googling solutions. Which I did find, and as usual I did have to adjust it at some places. And I do understand how to use it since
I did study it for some time (and will continue to study it). And reason why I actually never thought of it is quite simple, I have
never thought to use it in that way! I mean, using value of the input as index and testing if the indexOf is bigger than -1!

At least we learned some new things, used some things we already learned and we shall go forward to next challenge!
